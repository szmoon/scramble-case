# Acrylic case for the SCRAMBLE Macropad
## Version: Bamboo Mahjong Tile by szmoon

### Mahjong version notes

This is a slightly altered version of [dayofdoom](https://github.com/dayofdoom)'s [scramble-case](https://github.com/dayofdoom/scramble-case). Changes made:

* Borders are widened and overall board is slightly larger
* Corners are more rounded
* There are two additional layers so that the switches are more concealed
* Added svg/dxf file for KEY, which is the acrylic bamboo shape included in the resin keycaps
* Hardware change: this version uses 4x M2x15mm standoffs (instead of the original 9mm standoffs)

Additional photos and info for this build can be found on [szmoon's blog post](https://blog.selinazawacki.com/2022/01/24/mahjong-nullbits-scramble-board/).
